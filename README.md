# Monty-Hall
The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle which seems counter-intuitive. 
Imagine you are on a game show in which there are 3 doors to choose from, 
2 of them have goats behind them, and 1 of them has a brand-new car.

The host asks you to choose a door. 
Next, the host opens one of the unchosen doors which contains a goat behind it.
He now asks you, "Would you like to switch your choice to the remaining door?"
Now you might think, "There are now 2 doors left, so there must be a 50-50 chance for me to win."
However, if you switch, you will have a 2/3 chance of winning, and 1/3 chance of winning.

Don't believe it? This program can run thousands of rounds of the game and will infact show that you 
have a 2/3 chance of winning if you switch your choice.

I further plan on adding a GUI in which a user can play the game.
